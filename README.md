To-Do List App

This To-Do List App is a simple yet functional project built using React, demonstrating essential concepts and best practices for managing state, handling events, and rendering dynamic content.

Key Features
Functional Components:

    The app is structured using functional components, allowing for a clear separation of concerns. The App component acts as the main container, while smaller components, like NewTodoForm, handle specific tasks.

JSX (JavaScript XML):

    The UI is constructed using JSX, making it intuitive to write and visualize the structure of the app.

State Management with useState:

    The app utilizes the useState hook to manage the list of to-dos, ensuring the UI updates in response to user actions.

Side Effects with useEffect:

    The useEffect hook manages side effects, such as fetching data or persisting to-dos in local storage, ensuring the app responds appropriately to lifecycle events.

User Input and Event Handling:

    The app captures user input via a form, with event handlers managing form submissions to dynamically add tasks to the list.

Props for Component Communication:

    Props facilitate communication between components, allowing parent components to pass data and handlers to child components effectively.

Dynamic Rendering of Lists:

    The app uses JavaScript's map() function to render a list of to-do items, employing unique keys to optimize rendering efficiency.

Conditional Rendering:

    Conditional rendering displays messages based on the app's state, enhancing user experience when there are no tasks available.

State Lifting:

    State lifting enables the parent component to manage the to-do state, making it accessible to child components like the form for adding new tasks.

Component Reusability:

    The app encourages reusability through modular components, ensuring a clean and maintainable codebase.

Styling:

    Custom styles are applied using CSS modules or inline styles to enhance the visual appeal of the app.
